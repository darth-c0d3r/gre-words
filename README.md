## How to Run?
Just run ```python3 practice.py```. It will read the words from words.txt and display them sequentially. First, a word will be shown and after pressing enter, it's meaning will show up. Here you can mark it correct or incorrect, that is if you got the answer right or not. It has various options like shuffle and reverse. Once you are gone through all the words or discontinue practice, it will repeat all the words that you got incorrect in the practice. This cycle keeps running iteratively untill you've gotten all the answers right.
